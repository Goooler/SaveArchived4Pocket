# Save Archived for Pocket

Do you ever read an article and think: "I should save this for later reference?"

When this happens to me I share it into Pocket, open the Pocket app, wait for the new item to sync,
and then immediately archive it.

This app shortens the process to simply sharing to SA4P. The app takes care of adding it to Pocket
and then performing the archive.

Is it overkill? Yes. But I've done the manual dance over one hundred times and I'm done with it.


## Install

Play Store coming soon. Maybe. Maybe not.

Debug and release APKs signed with the upload key are available on each GitHub Action build for now.
